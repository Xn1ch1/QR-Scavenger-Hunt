# QR-Scavenger-Hunt
QR Code Scavenger Hunt App

A Simple App for scavenger hunts. Allows up to 10 clues assigned to 10 QR codes. Any code will do as long as all 10 are unique.

Two screens available, one for setting the clues, one for solving the clues. If no hunt has been set, the solve clues screen will be disabled. Once a hunt has begun, you will need to scan the last code to unlock the set clues screen again.

The app uses the camera and Google Vision API to scan barcodes.
